        <h1>Aaron Hobson</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my website! It's a little plain right now, but soon it'll be on fleek.</p>

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I was born in Detroit, MI and grew up in Muskegon, MI. I have four sisters and two brothers. I have a wife and a 1 year old daughter.</p>

        <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
        <p>I love homemade pizza. I find the franchise stuff, like Dominoes, to be too salty and greasy! Trader Joe's makes some really good pizza though. It's cheap, too.</p>

        <h2>My Favorite Movies</h2>
        <p>The comedy <em>Friday</em> starring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube">Ice Cube</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_%281995_film%29">Chris Tucker</a>. I've seen that movie probably more than any other, and that's a lot because I don't really watch movies too often.</p>
