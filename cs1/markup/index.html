My Favorite Food
I love homemade pizza. I find the franchise stuff, like Dominoes, to be too salty and greasy! Trader Joe's makes some really good pizza though. It's cheap, too.

My Favorite Movies
The classic comedy "Friday" starring Ice Cube and Chris Tucker. I've seen that movie probably more than any other, and that's a lot because I don't really watch movies too often. 

Here is an ordered list of some of my other favorite movies:

Beauty and the Beast
Akira
Kazaam
Breathless

My Favorite Video Games
I love turn-based, party-based dungeon crawler RPGs. That's a mouthful, huh? Right now my favorite game in this genre is Stranger in Sword City. It's very nice. Check it out. 

Here is an unordered list of some of my other favorite games:

Baldur's Gate II
Chrono Trigger
Might and Magic VII
Diablo III
