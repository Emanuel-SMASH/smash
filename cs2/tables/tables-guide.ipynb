    "<h2>What is a database?</h2>\n",
    "<p>In the world of CS, a <b>database</b> is data organized into <b>tables</b> for computer processing.\n",
    "<br>Such data is usually very large, comes from various sources, and quite messy. \n",
    "<br>Hence the need to organize it in a uniform way.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>A spreadsheet (e.g., Excel) can <i>behave</i> like a database table, but is not necessarily one.\n",
    "<br>This is because spreadsheets can represent data in a non-uniform way.\n",
    "<br>Spreadsheets are the wild west when it comes to data.  There are no rules, really.\n",
    "<br>This means, in terms of structure, a spreadsheet is like a box of chocolates: you never know what you're going to get.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>On the contrary, database tables <b>must</b> be uniform. \n",
    "<br>\"Uniform\" means there are very strict rules that must be followed or the database will break. \n",
    "<br>Again, because there is so much data, things need to be well-defined and consistent.\n",
    "<br>The rows and columns in a database table aren't just there for show, unlike with a spreadsheet.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>I hope as you play with databases, you'll slowly learn the rules through experience.\n",
    "<br>Experience is the best teacher, after all.</p>"

    "<br><img src=\"table-example.png\" alt=\"table-example.png\">\n",
    "<br>Those are the rules. Too simple, one might say.\n",
    "<br>Namely, everything is a <b>record</b> (we see them as \"rows\"). \n",
    "<br>There are <b>no</b> \"empty\" rows. The size of the table is always exactly the number of records it contains.\n",
    "<br>Records consist of a bunch of <b>fields</b>, like id, age, weight, favorite ice cream flavor, etc.\n",
    "<br>These fields are the columns. They <i>define</i> the records.\n",
    "<br>If you insert a record into the table, you'll need to insert values in the exact order that the fields appear.\n",
    "<br>So if I add an employee to the table, I'd need to specify <i>EmpNo, Name, Age, Department, Salary,</i> in that exact order.\n",
    "<br>Spreadsheets allow you to get away with organizing this stuff however you want. You can even use pictures, have empty rows, etc.\n",

    "<br>SQL is a way to talk to a database and manage it with the quickness.\n",

    "<br>In a <b>relational database</b>, records in one table point or “relate” to records in other tables. \n",

    "<br>It's right there in the name: Relational. Database. Management. System. Mind = blown!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>There are many RDBMS in the industry that work with the standard SQL language, each with its own unique features. \n",
    "<br>Some popular ones are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "<br>It's all still SQL, just with a hint of pepper here, a dash of object-oriented programming there... \n",
    "<br>So learning standard SQL syntax is the first step toward understanding these RDBMS.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>RDBMS, like all I just mentioned, usually require a client-server environment, since most databases exist on servers. \n",
    "<br>For example, your Facebook account data (pictures, status updates, etc) is not stored in your phone or computer.\n",
    "<br>It is \"fetched\" from a gigantic database server, which is almost certainly managed by a RDBMS.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>We will use a lightweight RDBMS called <b>SQLite</b>. \n",
    "<br>SQLite uses standard-yet-simplified SQL syntax. \n",
    "<br>Most importantly, SQLite was made to be run within a client itself (i.e., your phone).\n",
    "<br>It is popular among applications with embedded databases (e.g., a Pokemon game).</p>\n",
